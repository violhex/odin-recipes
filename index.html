    <h2>Peach-Stuffed Pork Chops</h2>
    <p>For this peach-stuffed pork chops recipe, I'm going to show you my favorite technique for stuffing pork chops, as well as one of my favorite stuffings for pork. Above and beyond producing something that's visually impressive, we are also flavoring our pork chops from the inside out with this method. So, this is basically a technique video and will work no matter what stuffing you decide to useâ€”although this peach stuffing is absolutely delicious.</p>
